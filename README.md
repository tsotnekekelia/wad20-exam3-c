# Tasks
  
Modify [/routes/users.js](./routes/users.js).

1. Add a new `POST` route `localhost:3000/users/:id`, where `id` is a route parameter _**[4 points]**_
    1. Endpoint will also receive JSON object in the body of the request, something like this:
    
    ```
        {
            "property": "email",
            "value": "new@address.com"   
        }
    ```

2. Endpoint should read local [/data/users.js](./data/users.js) file 
and if user with provided `id` is found, their respective `property` needs to be updated with provided `value`, after updating property, user object needs to be returned as 
an endpoint response, otherwise return error `404` _**[10 points]**_
3. In case user is found, after updating users' property, persist changes by writing updated users array in to the [/data/users.js](./data/users.js) file _**[6 points]**_
    1. **Note**: make sure that you do not lose records of the other users
4. Only certain properties can be changed for the user, 
so validate that sent `property` is one of these: 
`firstname, lastname, email, avatar, occupation`.
in case validation fails return response with status code `400` _**[5 points]**_
